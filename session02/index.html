<p class= "MediumVioletRed">Hanes Mens Pullover Ecosmart Fleece Hooded Sweatshirt </p>
<p class= "indigotext">I was indecisive on what size to get and I went through all of the questions and reviews to see if anyone who was similar to me provided any helpful info. No one did. So I hope this helps someone. I'm a 5'5" 200lb woman, carry my weight in chest and hips. Ordered XXL because I like my hoodies roomy. It was a just a little roomier than I would have liked, but it shrunk a little bit when I laundered it, so now it's <span class= "limetext"> perfect.</span> The sleeves are a little long, but not cumbersome. The bottom band hugs my hips not too loose, not too tight. It's very soft, lightweight, and warm. I would have given five stars, but I noticed it has a hole in the seam at the cuff and now I have to return it, which is adds a little chore to my to-do list.</p>

<p class= darkviolettext>Just received the hoodie in the mail. Sleeve length is great, I also love the cuffs on the sleeves, very snug on my wrists which I like. The width of the hoodie in the body is also really nice (large size). What I'm not so fond of is the length of the body of the hoodie. It's a little to short, and I'm assuming it will shrink up a bit as well, so I'm afraid it won't fit very well once I wash it. But as of right now, it does fit pretty well and has <span class= "limetext"> good warmth! </span></p>
		 
<p class= "mediumpurpletext"> <span class= "limetext">This is EXACTLY what I look for EVERY fall/winter with no luck. </span> Who knew I should have been checking the men's section? Anyway, I am 5'11", 235lbs, usually wear size 16 bottoms and about size 10-12 tops and have a 36GG bra size. I ordered the medium, and while it IS snug over my chest, it is still just the perfect balance of comfort and style. My figure doesn't get lost under this hoodie, but I can still wear it with no shapewear and be super comfortable. I recommend this hoodie to EVERYONE!</p>
		 
<p class= "orchidtext"> Used it for an E.T. sort of costume, fits good and quality is OK for the price</p>
